    "Abstraction is a fundamental principle in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining the interface and behavior of an object, without exposing the internal implementation. Abstraction allows us to work with objects at a higher level of conceptualization, without needing to understand the intricacies of their implementation.\n",

    " Differences between Abstraction vs Encapsulation:--\n",
    " \n",
    ".  Abstraction shows only useful data by providing the most necessary details, whereas Encapsulation wraps code and data for necessary information.\n",
    ".  Abstraction is focused mainly on what should be done, while Encapsulation is focused on how it should be done.\n",
    ".  Abstraction hides complexity by giving you a more abstract picture, while Encapsulation hides internal work so that you can change it later.\n",
    ".  Abstraction helps you to partition the program into many independent portions, whereas Encapsulation is easy to change with new requirements.\n",
    ".  Comparing Encapsulation vs Abstraction, Abstraction solves problems at the design level while Encapsulation solves problems at the implementation level.\n",
    ".  Abstraction hides the irrelevant details found in the code, whereas Encapsulation helps developers to organize the entire code easily.\n",

    "Example of Abstraction:--\n",
    "                          Suppose you want to create a banking application and you are asked to collect all the information about your customer. There are chances that you will come up with the following information about the customer.\n",
    "[Full name,Address,Contact number,tax information,(Favorite Food, Favorite Movie, Favorite Actor)]\n",
    "\n",
    "But, not all of the above information is required to create a banking application.\n",
    "So, you need to select only the useful information for your banking application from that pool. Data like name, address, tax information, etc. make sense for a banking application.\n",
    "[Full name, Address, Contact Number, Tax Information]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have fetched/removed/selected the customer information from a larger pool, the process is referred to as Abstraction.\n",
    "However, the same information once extracted can be used for a wide range of applications. For instance, you can use the same data for hospital application, job portal application, a Government database, etc. with little or no modification. Hence, it becomes your Master Data. This is an advantage of Abstraction.\n",

    "Example of Encapsulation:--\n",
    "                            Let’s take an example of mobile device. With the help of mobile devices, you can perform various functions like taking a picture, sending a message, recording video/ audio, access the web and much more.\n",
    "The features mentioned above are functionalities of most of the smartphone. However, you don’t need to understand the internal functioning details of those features before using this program. Example, you don’t need to know how your camera calculates gamma correction or identifies a human face in an image. You just need to learn the software interface. This is encapsulation."

    "The abc module provides the ABC class, which is a metaclass that allows you to create abstract base classes. By inheriting from ABC and using the @abstractmethod decorator, you can define abstract methods within the abstract base class. An abstract method is a method that has no implementation in the base class but must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python is used for the following purposes:--\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): The abc module provides the infrastructure to define abstract base classes. An abstract base class can define abstract methods, properties, and class-level attributes. Subclasses of the abstract base class are then expected to provide concrete implementations for these abstract elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Enforcing Method Implementation: Abstract methods defined within an abstract base class act as placeholders that subclasses must override and implement. The use of abstract methods ensures that subclasses adhere to a certain interface or behavior defined by the abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Type Checking and Polymorphism: Abstract base classes can be used for type checking and to establish a common interface among related classes. By using ABCs, you can determine if an object is an instance of a particular abstract base class, even if it belongs to a subclass. This allows for polymorphism and facilitates code that can work with objects of different concrete classes as long as they share the same abstract base class."
