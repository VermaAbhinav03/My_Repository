    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called an object. It allows the object to control access to its internal state, ensuring that data is accessed and modified only through defined methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes, allowing the derived classes to inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class. It promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes. The derived classes can add new features or modify existing ones through overriding or extending the inherited methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability to present a single interface with multiple implementations. Polymorphism enables the use of a generic interface to work with objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It allows the creation of abstract classes or interfaces that define the common structure and behavior without specifying implementation details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, enhancing modularity, and providing a clear separation between the interface and implementation.\n",
