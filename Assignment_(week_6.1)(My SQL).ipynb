    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.\n",
    "Example - Creating a new table:\n",

    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",

    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects from the database. It removes the specified object and its associated data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Dropping a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "In this example, the DROP TABLE statement deletes the 'employees' table from the database.\n",

    "Example - Adding a new column to a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",

    "Sure, let's start with the definitions of Primary Key and Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key**:\n",
    "   - A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row (record) in that table.\n",
    "   - It must contain unique values, meaning that no two rows in the table can have the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "   - Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity, ensuring that each record in the table is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "   - In most relational database systems, primary keys are automatically indexed for faster data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign Key**:\n",
    "   - A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship with another table's primary key or a unique key.\n",
    "   - It represents a link or a reference between two tables, indicating that the values in the foreign key column(s) of one table correspond to the values in the primary key column(s) of another table.\n",
    "   - Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that the relationships between related tables remain valid.\n",
    "   - By defining foreign key constraints, database systems can automatically enforce rules such as cascading updates or deletes, ensuring data consistency across related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concepts of primary key and foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables: `employees` and `departments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `employees` table:\n",
    "  - Columns: `employee_id` (Primary Key), `first_name`, `last_name`, `department_id` (Foreign Key), `salary`, etc.\n",
    "  - The `employee_id` column uniquely identifies each employee record.\n",
    "  - The `department_id` column establishes a relationship with the `departments` table, indicating the department to which each employee belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `departments` table:\n",
    "  - Columns: `department_id` (Primary Key), `department_name`, `location`, etc.\n",
    "  - The `department_id` column uniquely identifies each department record.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `employee_id` serves as the primary key in the `employees` table, while `department_id` serves as both a primary key in the `departments` table and a foreign key in the `employees` table. The foreign key relationship between the two tables ensures that each employee is associated with a valid department, maintaining data integrity and consistency within the database."
